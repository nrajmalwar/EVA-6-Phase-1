## [1. Train a Simple Neural Network using Microsoft Excel](Backpropagation_Calculations)

## [2. Optimize MNIST Network](MNIST_Network)

# MNIST Classification using stripped down network with less than 20,000 parameters
The objective is to optimize a network combining many deep learning techniques on the layers and use very few parameters to achieve high accuracy

## Data Preprocessing

* Create dataloader object for the train and test data for the MNIST dataset and apply normalization using mean and std deviation values of (0.1307,), (0.3081,)
* Batch size = 28
